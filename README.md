# caesar-decipher
### Key files:
* decipher.py
* cipher.txt
* 1-1000.txt
### How it Works:
The 1-1000 text file contains the 1000 most common English words. The python file takes a caesar's cipher, narrows down the potential outcomes, then picks the outcome that contains the most common English words. Since the only single letter English words are "a" and "I", the python code narrows the possible answers to 2 outcomes.
